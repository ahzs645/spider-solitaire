## How To Play

- The goal of the game is to complete 8 decks of cards and not leave any cards on the board.
- The cards should be sorted from left to right as in the example (contrary to the real rules): [A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K]
- If there are no more moves to be played, the card must be dealt.
- If there is an empty column, no cards can be dealt.
- You can click on the green box to get suggestions.
- If all the cards are dealt and there are no more moves to be played, the new game can be started.
